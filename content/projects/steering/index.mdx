The Steering Law is a robust model to predict the movement time (*MT*) for steering through a constrained path, and the most representative example in human-computer interaction (HCI) is navigating cascaded menus. 
In typical implementations of cascaded menus, however, users can deviate from the path for a short time; we call this error-accepting delay, or *T<sub>delay</sub>*.
Yamanaka modified the Steering Law to predict *MT* under several *T<sub>delay</sub>* conditions, and our goal is to investigate the reproducibility of his model with more various *T<sub>delay</sub>* values. 
In addition, HCI researchers have recently formed a consensus that the goodness of models should be judged by the prediction accuracy for future (untested) task conditions. 
Thus, for the sake of completeness, we conducted two analyses: a shuffle-split cross-validation and leave-one-*T<sub>delay</sub>*-out cross-validation. 
The results showed that, regardless of the all-data and cross-validation analyses, Yamanaka's modified model outperformed the baseline Steering Law, which strengthened his original experimental report.
